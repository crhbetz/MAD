Map'A'Droid is a scanner for PoGo based on Android devices.

This repo contains a couple of feature branches that didn't make it to the main project. They are merged to `master` when I use them. I try to keep master and feature branches synced with upstream updates as good as I can. Sometimes I cherry-pick minor features or fixes from upstream dev into my master.

Besides that, I also track personal customizations for my setup here in the `pogoan*` branches.
